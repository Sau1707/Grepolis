# Sentinel Indicator

### How it work:

Add a green shield to all the polis that has a troop inside, the green shield it's visible only on the client side and therefore there is no risk of ban

To make it efficient the script save the polis that has the shield and update only the one that change the state. Furthermore, all the calculation are done only when the user moves the screen.
